# About Portainer 
Portainer is a powerful and user-friendly open source management tool for managing Docker environments. It provides a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily manage Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes. With Portainer, users can create, edit, and delete containers and images, as well as monitor and troubleshoot the overall performance of their Docker environment.


# Portainer Auto Script
Portainer does not have a built-in feature to automatically convert YAML Docker files to JSON format and save them to a file. However, it is possible to write a script to perform this task using this program.
